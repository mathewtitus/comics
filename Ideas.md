### Bugs
Algae fungus bacteria to Venus
- Evolutionary freefall, interplanetary competition
Cause: Earth runs out of resources

Discover through this that Earth is not the first planet we've destroyed
Mercury -> Mars -> Earth ( -> Venus )

On Earth: Conscientious objectors vs. War hawks

Then Venus bugs send their own bugs off - el fin.

### Greedy fucking capitalists

There's some Rockefeller style mother fucker running the world

Niece or nephew [[Jaime]] ([[Characters]]) sells their stakes in big company to fund desalinization etc, humanitarian work

Expands business for metals etc., creates new "good" company, excavates Mars/Mercury
	Find vaults on Mars; opens and living people are tucked in there.
	They're waiting for Mars to become habitable again.
What does the niece do? Save, bring to Earth? Let them **die**?

This starts a downward trend.

### Protagonist becomes the villain

Plotline 1 - Capitalist boi/grrl is fighting the establishment & Ayn Randing the climate crisis etc. while
Plotline 2 - Greedy fucking capitalist devoid of humanity runs the megacorporations of earth; late in the story -

we realize our Hero from plot1 is the younger self of the Villain in plot2
